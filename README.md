## About me
My name is Arthur. I will be 26 in May. I study computer science. I have only one semester left and I have to write my thesis. <br>
I fell in love with front end 2.5 years ago thanks to [hello roman](https://www.youtube.com/c/helloroman). <br>
I try every day to pursue my goal of becoming a front end dev

## Projects

From the oldest pathetic attempts at programming to the newest slightly less pathetic attempts at programming!

* [_Modularity_react ](https://github.com/Arthvr96/_Modularity_react) - My first project in react. Simple landingpage. In the project you can still find the old class components!
* [ImmortalToDoList](https://github.com/Arthvr96/ImmortalToDoList) - Very funny readme, I recommend checking it out. <br>
After 'creating' an earlier project, I came to the conclusion that it's worth knowing js well first, so I went back to learning the basics and spent probably the most time on it.
* [Select-Plus-Rent](https://github.com/Arthvr96/Select-Rent-) - First major project for a real client. Unfortunately a pandemic ruined the plans as the company backed out of the idea to create a new site.
* [Sombreroprintswebsite](https://github.com/Arthvr96/Sombreroprintswebsite) - Quite an ambitious poster shop project. The plan was to integrate it with Shoplify. <br> Especially for this page I created a custom scroll like a full page. I did not use the ready-made solution because the client had a different vision, which I could not get with this package. <br>
Scroll works for mobile. Here the project was frozen because the client had problems with copyrights for sold products. <br>
The application within 3 months will be completed because I want to use it in my thesis.
* [helios-employees-management-system](https://github.com/Arthvr96/helios-employees-management-system/tree/demonstration) - The most ambitious project of my life, which has grown to a huge size and is used by one cinema in Poland. <br>I came up with the idea myself and proposed it to a colleague who is the person responsible for creating work schedules. <br>The process of collecting dispositions sent by employees was horrible (via email). I decided to improve it but I did not expect it to grow so much. <br>
The application is not finished yet and I plan to expand it in the future.<br>
The main feature is the automatic schedule generator. The script itself is working. It is just waiting for optimization and implementation of frontend
* [Jelly-fox](https://github.com/Arthvr96/jelly-fox) - Portfolio type site for a graphic designer. This is currently the main project on which I focus. First project in Gatsby!

## Skillset

Analyzing what I found in job offers + based on what I found on roadmaps and yt I tried to rate myself.<br>
I created a scale :<br>
60% - junior threshold for most offers <br> 80% - definitely junior threshold + I feel very confident in a given technology. <br> 100% - knowledge slightly exceeding junior requirements.
