## About me
I‚Äôm (almost) 26 years old student of computer science. Only one semester (and 60 pages thesis) away from getting my diploma and finally pursuing my long-lasting* dream of becoming a frontend developer. <br><br>

*Okey, maybe not that long-lasting. The dream was born 3 years ago thanks to one and only [hello roman](https://www.youtube.com/c/helloroman). 

## Projects

Proud to present a couple of my projects from the very first attempts to the newest ones!

* [_Modularity_react ](https://github.com/Arthvr96/_Modularity_react) - My very first attempt in programming with React. The project of a landing page with the fine old class components.¬†
* [ImmortalToDoList](https://github.com/Arthvr96/ImmortalToDoList) - Back to the basic kind of project. The First LP project showed me fundamentals are key. The project despite its simplicity required me to invest loads of time but helped me create a strong base for further development. PS you gotta read ‚Äúreadme‚Äù it‚Äôs hilarious.¬†
* [Select-Plus-Rent](https://github.com/Arthvr96/Select-Rent-) - First major project for a real client. Unfortunately a pandemic ruined the plans as the company backed out of the idea to create a new site.
* [Sombreroprintswebsite](https://github.com/Arthvr96/Sombreroprintswebsite) - Quite an ambitious poster shop project. The plan was to integrate it with Shoplify. <br> Especially for this page I created a custom scroll like a full page. I did not use the ready-made solution because the client had a different vision, which I could not get with this package. <br>
Scroll works for mobile. Here the project was frozen because the client had problems with copyrights for sold products. <br>
The application within 3 months will be completed because I want to use it in my thesis.
* [helios-employees-management-system](https://github.com/Arthvr96/helios-employees-management-system/tree/demonstration) - *App completed and in use!*<br> The most ambitious project of my life, which has grown to a huge size and is used by one cinema in Poland. <br>I came up with the idea myself and proposed it to a colleague who is the person responsible for creating work schedules. <br>The process of collecting dispositions sent by employees was horrible (via email). I decided to improve it but I did not expect it to grow so much. <br>
The application allows you to collect employees' dispositions for a new work week. The administrator can create new accounts and edit existing ones. The application has a module that automatically generates most of the schedule. 
Detailed description of the project at the link. In the future there will be a demo available (the current demo is an older version).

* [Jelly-fox](https://github.com/Arthvr96/jelly-fox) - *Suspended* <br> Portfolio type site for a graphic designer. This is currently the main project on which I focus. First project in Gatsby!

* [Select-Plus-Rent-TS](https://github.com/Arthvr96/select-plus-rent-ts) - *currently under development* <br> Recreating an old project ([Select-Plus-Rent](https://github.com/Arthvr96/Select-Rent-)) completely from scratch. Using typescirpt. This project will be a good way to evaluate my learning progress.

## Skillset

I created a chart of my skills. I created the scale based on an analysis of what I found in job listings for juniors and early mids + my experience with recruitment tasks and also technical interviews.<br><br>

0 - 49% - still a lot of learning. <br>
50% - 69% - enough knowledge for a junior. <br>
70% - 100% - very good knowledge, beyond the junior's tag.<br><br>
