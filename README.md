# 👋 Hi, I’m Artur

I’m a **Frontend Developer with 4 years of commercial experience** at **Sii Poland**.  
Before my current role, I worked as a **freelancer for around 1.5 years**.
I’ve been learning and working with frontend technologies for **over 8 years** in total.

At the moment, I’m **aspiring to a Senior Frontend Developer role**, while actively expanding my skills toward **full-stack development**, this is my main career goal for **2026**.

## Projects

Below you’ll find a list of my projects created **before landing my first job as a Junior Frontend Developer**.  
Please be kind when it comes to code quality, I’m fully aware that some of it hasn’t aged well 😄  
One of those projects still needs occasional fixing, which is a good reminder of how much I’ve learned since then.

* [Modularity](https://github.com/Arthvr96/Modularity) - My very first attempt in programming with React. The project of a landing page with the fine old class components.

* [ImmortalToDoList](https://github.com/Arthvr96/ImmortalToDoList) - Back to the basic kind of project. The first project showed me how important foundations are. Because of my big deficiencies in javascript, I had huge problems understanding how react works not to mention writing optimal solutions there. After many frustrating failures I returned to learning js. I studied es5 and es6 very thoroughly. After carefully going through a few courses about js, and re-working 3 courses about React, I decided to do a simple project to see if it was still so painful for me to use React. Definitely, it was more enjoyable.<br> You won't find anything revealing there, but you gotta read “readme” it’s hilarious. 

* [Select-Plus-Rent-old](https://github.com/Arthvr96/Select-Rent-) - First major project for a real client. Unfortunately a pandemic ruined the plans as the company backed out of the idea to create a new site. ([select-plus-rent-ts](https://github.com/Arthvr96/select-plus-rent-ts) - New version of the site created in gatsby + typescirpt)

* [Sombreroprintswebsite](https://github.com/Arthvr96/Sombreroprintswebsite) - Quite an ambitious poster shop project. The plan was to integrate it with Shoplify. <br> Especially for this page I created a custom scroll like a full page. I did not use the ready-made solution because the client had a different vision, which I could not get with this package. <br>
Scroll works for mobile. Here the project was frozen because the client had problems with copyrights for sold products. <br>

* [helios-employees-management-system](https://github.com/Arthvr96/helios-employees-management-system/tree/demonstration) - *App completed and in use!*<br> The most ambitious project of my life, which has grown to a huge size and is used by one cinema in Poland. <br>I came up with the idea myself and proposed it to a colleague who is the person responsible for creating work schedules. <br>The process of collecting dispositions sent by employees was horrible (via email). I decided to improve it but I did not expect it to grow so much. <br>
The application allows you to collect employees' dispositions for a new work week. The administrator can create new accounts and edit existing ones. The application has a module that automatically generates most of the schedule. 
Detailed description of the project at the link. In the future there will be a demo available (the current demo is an older version).

* [Select-Plus-Rent-TS](https://github.com/Arthvr96/select-plus-rent-ts) - <br> Recreating an old project ([Select-Plus-Rent-old](https://github.com/Arthvr96/Select-Rent-)) completely from scratch. Tech stack: Gatsby + typescript. The project is intended to help me improve my Gatsby skills, as well as allow me to make my first serious use of typescript in a project. I also plan to fully test the application. Unit and integration tests, as well as e2e.<br>
Also this project, compared to the old version, will be a great demonstration of how my programming skills have changed over 2 years.<br>
