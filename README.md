## About me
I‚Äôm 26 years old student of computer science. Only thesis away from getting my diploma.<br>

The dream (becoming front-end dev) was born at the beginning of 2019, thanks to one and only [hello roman](https://www.youtube.com/c/helloroman). 

## Projects

Proud to present a couple of my projects from the very first attempts to the newest ones!

* [Modularity](https://github.com/Arthvr96/Modularity) - My very first attempt in programming with React. The project of a landing page with the fine old class components.

* [ImmortalToDoList](https://github.com/Arthvr96/ImmortalToDoList) - Back to the basic kind of project. The first project showed me how important foundations are. Because of my big deficiencies in javascript, I had huge problems understanding how react works not to mention writing optimal solutions there. After many frustrating failures I returned to learning js. I studied es5 and es6 very thoroughly. After carefully going through a few courses about js, and re-working 3 courses about React, I decided to do a simple project to see if it was still so painful for me to use React. Definitely, it was more enjoyable.<br> You won't find anything revealing there, but you gotta read ‚Äúreadme‚Äù it‚Äôs hilarious.¬†

* [Select-Plus-Rent-old](https://github.com/Arthvr96/Select-Rent-) - First major project for a real client. Unfortunately a pandemic ruined the plans as the company backed out of the idea to create a new site. ([select-plus-rent-ts](https://github.com/Arthvr96/select-plus-rent-ts)New version of the site created in gatsby + typescirpt)

* [Sombreroprintswebsite](https://github.com/Arthvr96/Sombreroprintswebsite) - Quite an ambitious poster shop project. The plan was to integrate it with Shoplify. <br> Especially for this page I created a custom scroll like a full page. I did not use the ready-made solution because the client had a different vision, which I could not get with this package. <br>
Scroll works for mobile. Here the project was frozen because the client had problems with copyrights for sold products. <br>
The project will most likely be resumed due to its use in the thesis.

* [helios-employees-management-system](https://github.com/Arthvr96/helios-employees-management-system/tree/demonstration) - *App completed and in use!*<br> The most ambitious project of my life, which has grown to a huge size and is used by one cinema in Poland. <br>I came up with the idea myself and proposed it to a colleague who is the person responsible for creating work schedules. <br>The process of collecting dispositions sent by employees was horrible (via email). I decided to improve it but I did not expect it to grow so much. <br>
The application allows you to collect employees' dispositions for a new work week. The administrator can create new accounts and edit existing ones. The application has a module that automatically generates most of the schedule. 
Detailed description of the project at the link. In the future there will be a demo available (the current demo is an older version).

* [Jelly-fox](https://github.com/Arthvr96/jelly-fox) - *Suspended* <br> Portfolio type site for a graphic designer. First project in Gatsby! The client decided that she would be responsible for UI & UX herself. The work has been put on hold because, I am still waiting for a number of graphics and sub-page designs.  

* [Select-Plus-Rent-TS](https://github.com/Arthvr96/select-plus-rent-ts) - *currently under development* <br> Recreating an old project ([Select-Plus-Rent-old](https://github.com/Arthvr96/Select-Rent-)) completely from scratch. Tech stack: Gatsby + typescript. The project is intended to help me improve my Gatsby skills, as well as allow me to make my first serious use of typescript in a project. I also plan to fully test the application. Unit and integration tests, as well as e2e.<br>
Also this project, compared to the old version, will be a great demonstration of how my programming skills have changed over 2 years.

Scheduled projects:

1)[Sombreroprintswebsite](https://github.com/Arthvr96/Sombreroprintswebsite) - Resuming work on the project. Possible migration to TS.
2)[Jelly-fox](https://github.com/Arthvr96/jelly-fox) - Resume work on the project, if the necessary materials are provided by the client. Migration to ts. 
3)helios-employees-management-system-2.0 - The current application is based on firebase. All logic is on the front end which made me unable to use firebase admin sdk. The application is unscalable, resistant to adaptation for other cinemas with different intrasctructure and is difficult to maintain.<br> 
The project involves splitting the logic into a separate backend project. I intend to take up node.js and write the entire project from scratch with the ability to scale and customize easily. The target plan is to use the application throughout the helios network. 

## Skillset

I created a chart of my skills. I created the scale based on an analysis of what I found in job listings for juniors and early mids + my experience with recruitment tasks and also technical interviews.<br><br>

0 - 49% - still a lot of learning. <br>
50% - 69% - enough knowledge for a junior. <br>
70% - 100% - very good knowledge, beyond the junior's tag.<br><br>
